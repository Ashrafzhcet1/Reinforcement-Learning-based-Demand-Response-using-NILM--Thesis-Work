# NILM-Thesis-Work
Non Intrustive Load Monitoring

For my thesis "Reinforcement Learning Based Demand Response", the objective is recommendation for the household electical load to 
decrease electricity cost following the below steps:
1. Using REFIT dataset prediction of next 24 hour electricity load. The prediction is done by LSTM, NARX, RNN, SVM, Fine Tree.
2. Load disaggregation is done by NILMTK using Combinatorial Optimisation, FHMM, MEAN and HART85.
3. Q-Learing is employed to give recommendations to decresae electicity cost.
